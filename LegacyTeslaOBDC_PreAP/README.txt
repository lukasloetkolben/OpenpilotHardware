These files can be used to manufacture an OBD-C connector for a Pre-AutoPilot (PreAP) Tesla Model S. As of time of writing, this module only supports this variation of the Model S and an Open Pilot fork called Tesla Unity. 

The pick and place file excludes the OBD-II connector as they were hard to source from my manufacturer at the time. 

Suggested modifications:

-Create a ground plane for better signal integrity (thank you Lukas for the suggestion)
